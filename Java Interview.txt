Difference between Abstract class and Interface.
- The basic difference between in Abstract and Interface is Abstract class have abstract and non-abstract methods in it and Interface have only abstract methods but from Java 8 in interface having Static methods and Default methods.
- Both Abstract and Interface is use to achieve hide the internal details and shows only functionality.
- We cant extend Multiple class but we can implement multiple Interfaces

What are wrapper class in java.
- Wrapper class is provide us to use Primitive type as a Object.
- Like fore Example Integer, Boolean etc. is Wrapper classes in Java.
- Mainly we can use Wrapper Class in Java where we need the Generic type Like For example ArrayList having only Generic type.

Have you used design pattern.
- Yes I used Design Pattern Like Singleton Design pattern and Factory Design Pattern.

java 8 feature
- Functional Interface
- lambda Expression
- Method Reference
- Stream API
- Optional Class

what is optional class
- In Java 8 Optional Class is use to avoid NullPointerException
- We will create using Optional.ofNullable(returnvalue)

what is method reference
- Method Reference is just like replacement of Lambda Expression
- We can use to call with double semicolon ::
- Its just like we can call static method using class name

What is IOC and Dependency Injection in Spring
- Inversion Of Control is nothing but gives the control to spring IOC Container and as developer we can focusing on our business logic
- So Spring IOC Container will take care of life cycle of your object
- Dependency Injection is way to implementation Inversion Of Control
- Dependency Injection means to inject the one object in onather  IOC coantiner

What are the different ways to achieve the dependency injection
- There is Construction injection and Setter Injection 

What are different bean Scope
- Bean Scope means the lifecycle of Beans in Spring Container
- There is commonly use Singleton and Prototype
- Singleton is define the only one instance is created and share across the entire spring container here all request will retune the same instance of each time.
- Prototype is define the new instance of spring bean each time means it will create new instance in spring container for each request

Advantage of using Spring boot over Spring
- Spring Boot allows us to auto configuration for application using annotations
- It reduce so many Boilerplate code
- Spring boot provide us to Embedded Tomcat server
- Spring boot will create production ready application for us we need to just focus on our business logic

What is @SpringBootApplication Annotation in Spring boot
- Firstly it use to mark the class as starting point of Spring boot Application
- It is combination three annotation which is @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan and @Configuration
- Now in @EnableAutoConfiguration will enable the autoconfiguration means it will configure all the configuration if present in classpath
- In @ComponentScan will Scan all component which is present in application
- In @Configuration will help to define beans or classes which will return beans

Difference between @Controller and @RestController
- Controler annotation will mark our class as a spring MVC Controller so typically it use for web application where return type is view
- and other hand RestController is specialize version of Controller, It is combination of Controller and ResponceBody
- It is use for RESTfull web services instead of returning a view the RestController will return a Data mostly in Json format.

Can we use @Component annotation instead of @Service or @Repository annotation
- Yes we can use but it is Bad practice of Codding
- We need to annoted specific Annotation to tell the spring container

What is Lazy loading and Eager loading in Hibernate
- Lazy Loading means while we can call the explicitly method to load the data
- Eager loading means it will load data eagerly means it will load the data on the spot

What is Microservices
- In simple word microservices is the methodology which we can create the different applications with specific functionality of this application
